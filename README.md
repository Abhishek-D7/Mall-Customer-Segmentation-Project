# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Project

In my latest project, I explored the dynamic domain of Mall Customer Segmentation . Core Python formed the foundation for the entire implementation, while Numpy facilitated efficient numerical operations. Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, played a crucial role in handling and processing the dataset. The visual representation of data and model performance was accomplished using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm for clustering data points into distinct groups. Developing the algorithm from scratch provided a deep understanding of the process, from initializing centroids to optimizing cluster assignments.

In this project, Euclidean distance was employed as a metric to measure the dissimilarity between data points and centroids. The iterative optimization process involved adjusting centroids based on the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster.

The resulting clusters and spending predictions provided valuable insights for retailers. Understanding the distinct characteristics of each customer segment enabled targeted marketing strategies.
